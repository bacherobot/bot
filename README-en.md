# Bachero

Bachero is a Discord bot with the goal of replacing all the existing ones, bringing features that no one else has, and solving a lot of problems.

ðŸ‘‰ Open â€” open source, free and easily self-hostable

ðŸ‘‰ Modular â€” with the addition of ["add-ons"](https://bachero.johanstick.fr/en/docs/preinstalled)

ðŸ‘‰ Complete â€” everything other bots have, combined into one bot, and better

ðŸ‘‰ Customizable â€” Bachero isn't Bachero, it's your bot

ðŸ‘‰ Ready to serve â€” always ready to help you with an already hosted instance

### Reinvent the wheel can be a good idea

Many of them (probably more than half of the bots still active) offer users some commands that most other bots already have, some of them for several years, but none of them can really compete with them by bringing real progress.

Bachero is here for that, trying to solve most of the existing problems and bringing better solutions than the others:

* Everything that bots have, combined, and even better.
* Free, not like MEE6 Custom Bot that costs $11.99 per month
* Configurable with a single file

### Expandable

If you host Bachero yourself, you have the option of installing modules. Think of them as features you can add to Bachero, like commands or background functionality.

These modules can be created by anyone with some knowledge of Discord bot creation, but you can also install modules made by the community.
